# cobra-to-md
This repo provides a simple cobra command to convert your CLI to hierarchal markdown.
Note that the command is marked as hidden by default and won't appear in your CLI unless
you mark it `Hidden = false`.

The docs found in the example folder were generated by:
* building this project into a 'build' folder
* running the executable with the hidden `gendoc` command:
    
	./build/example gendoc --doc-output-dir ./example/docs

* committing the changeset
